Hi there! I have mainly worked on Android development so far, and I have occasionally done iOS development as well. ğŸš€ Currently, I am shifting my focus to a wide range of areas such as Flutter, Spring backend, and AWS infrastructure development. ğŸ˜™ Beside's programming, I enjoy watching science and space-related YouTube channels, and I also really like mysteries and horror stories. ğŸ“º
